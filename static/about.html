		For the last 16 years, I have lived in Moscow, Russia teaching English to Russians.
		In that time, I have become very adept at teaching and very knowledgeable about language(especially English and Russian).
		My strong backgound in language with 4 years of Latin, 
		3 years of French and 16 years of teaching English as a foreign language in Moscow Russia, 
		meeting IH-London standards with annual observations for continual improvement in 
		my teaching enable me to give you high quality English lessons.

		My diploma in Russian language, 14 weeks of immersion in the Russian language in Vermont and 6 weeks
		of living in the Soviet Union in Leningrad gave me a very strong basis in Russian language which I built
		on and practised for the 16 years I taught English in Moscow.
	</p>
	<p>
		I love teaching for two main reasons:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Because I love spending time on language and understanding it more deeply and seeing
			all the relations between languages, both in vocabulary and logic, and seeing the way
			different cultures view things in life their unique way and how it is reflected in their language.
		</li>
		<li>
			Because seeing people grow, learn and be able to do something that previously they were
			completely unable to do is something amazing and magic to me. 
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		To see someone go from understanding nothing as I speak to them in the language I am teaching them to
		being able to understand and produce in it 45 minutes later is amazing!
	</p>
	<p>
		My strongest assets are:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			My deep knowledge and natural talent for seeing the logic within language and between
			languages-this greatly helps the students understand and remember vocabulary better and
			understand the logic of the grammar. 
		</li>
		<li>
			I have spent more than 16 years abroad communicating with non-English speakers.
		</li>
		<li>
			I really enjoy working with people and that is reflected in the atmosphere and attitude in the lessons.
		</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

		If you need beginning grammar, vocabulary and simple practice, or you need to work on fluency in
		speech and listening with grammar and word choice correction or anything in between, contact me
		for interesting lessons bringing your English up to whatever level you need or desire. We can meet
		at your convenience anywhere in the Raleigh area, including Durham and especially Cary.

	<p>Looking forward to teaching you!</p>
	<p>Sincerely,</p>
