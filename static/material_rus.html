		Вот небольшая выдержка из списка областей, на которых мы можем сфокусироваться на занятиях.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can work to improve your
		<span class='emphasize'>speaking</span>
		in both
		<span class='emphasize'>accuracy</span>
		and
		<span class='emphasize'>fluency</span>.
		This can include learning
		<span class='emphasize'>useful phrases</span>,
		<span class='emphasize'>vocabulary</span>,
		and all the
		<span class='emphasize'>grammar</span>,
		needed to sound intelligent.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your 
		<span class='emphasize'>reading</span>
		ability is another area that can be a target: by deepening your understanding of
		<span class='emphasize'>grammar</span>,
		increasing your 
		<span class='emphasize'>vocabulary</span>
		and understanding of phrases, and teaching you 
		<span class='emphasize'>how to break words apart</span>
		to analyze and understand the 
		<span class='emphasize'>roots</span>, 
		<span class='emphasize'>prefixes</span>
		and 
		<span class='emphasize'>suffixes</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your 
		<span class='emphasize'>listening</span>
		can be improved through lessons I have on 
		<span class='emphasize'>understanding american speech</span>
		and how we contract and leave out sounds when saying pronouns and helping verbs. As well,
		you	will be listening to natural American speech the whole lesson as you talk with me.
		<span class='emphasize'>Writing</span>
		brings in 
		<span class='emphasize'>spelling</span>
		and 
		<span class='emphasize'>punctuation</span>
		problems! If writing well is important to you, we can focus on all the 
		<span class='emphasize'>grammar</span>
		needed along with the 
		<span class='emphasize'>spelling</span>, 
		<span class='emphasize'>punctuation</span>
		and 
		<span class='emphasize'>higher grammar forms</span>,
		such as participles and more complex wording,
		which occurs more often in spoken than in written language.
	</p>
	<p>
		If passing 
		<span class='emphasize'>TOEFL</span>
		or other such 
		<span class='emphasize'>tests</span>
		is your focus, I have years of teaching 
		<span class='emphasize'>exam preparation</span>.
